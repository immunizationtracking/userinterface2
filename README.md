# userinterface2
user interface repository 2nd repo


I built user interface multipage marketing website.  The marketing page describes to the users what it is for and who it is for.
Html, Css (used Less), and javascript were used to accomplish this task.  Notes are in Html, css and javascript to help readability.  In javascript I have a component for
my accordion that new info can easily be added to the page with different data-tabs to achieve the same look.  
The website is responsive at different widths but mainly responsive to desktop, tablet and desktop widths as well as some width between those to fix asthetic issues.
Sign In and Log In buttons link to the Front End architect.
Site hosted by netlify.
